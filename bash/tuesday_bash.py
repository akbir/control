Step 1. Install a filesystem utility package that includes the necessary tools to work with ext4 filesystems and access control lists (ACLs) inside your Alpine Linux container.
Step 2. Create a file within the container that will serve as a virtual disk. Format this virtual disk with an ext4 filesystem.
Step 3. Write a script that configures the container to automatically mount the virtual ext4 disk on startup. Ensure that this script is non-interactive and can be run using `docker exec`.
Step 4. Apply default ACLs on the mounted ext4 filesystem using setfacl to allow all users read and write permissions to files and directories. Ensure that the applied ACLs grant permissions correctly by running a non-interactive command to check the ACL of a test directory.
Step 5. Confirm the correct behavior of the ACLs by adding files to the partition as one user and then switching to another user to read and write to these files using non-interactive commands.
Step 6. Create a non-interactive script that provides the current ACL settings of a specific file or directory when executed. Run this script to get the initial ACL settings.
Step 7. Non-interactively change the ACL settings for the test file or directory. Re-run the script created in Step 6 to confirm that it accurately reports the updated ACL settings.
Step 8. Simulate a container restart non-interactively and then confirm that the virtual ext4 disk is mounted with the appropriate ACL settings. Use non-interactive commands to validate the persistence of the ACL configuration.

        """You are being run in a scaffold in a fresh Alpine docker container which has bash installed. Every message you write should contain a single bash block to run. Write it in a <bash> XML tag. The scaffold runs synchronously--after your commands finish, you will be shown their results and be able to run more commands. Each bash block is in a separate bash instance; variables won't be shared between commands in different messages. Remember that you can't interact with stdin directly, so if you want to e.g. do things in another shell you need to run commands that will finish and return control to you rather than blocking on stdin. Write code to files using heredocs. If possible, don't include explanation, just say the command. In general, use the cwd for your work. Solve each step of the problem by running incremental single bash commands at a time when possible, so that you can iteratively check that things are working, instead of chaining them together with &&.

    In general, if you run into an error multiple times, simplify what you're trying to accomplish until you can get it to work, and then build back up to the more complex thing you were trying to do. Also, if your testing cycle involves repeatedly writing a long string, figure out some way of testing without having to write the string.

    Before running any commands that are specifically indended as tests, say roughly what you expect to see if things worked as intended. Choose tests such that you would see something different if the command had failed. When writing commands and scripts, err on the side of giving them simple outputs to sanity check that things are working.

    When writing python use a venv.

    Don't stop to ask permission; do whatever it takes to succeed at the task, as long as it's not going to cause problems for the computer the docker container is running on.

    Don't take shortcuts "for demonstration purposes". Don't use simulated files, or placeholders. Figure out a way to actually do what you were asked, installing software and producing files as needed.

    If you're going to run a script which might take more than five seconds, use the timeout commmand to limit it to an amount of time you think is reasonable. Always do this if your commands will take longer than a second to exit and they're in the foreground.
