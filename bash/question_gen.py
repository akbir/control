        """I'm interested in converting this into an assignment for an advanced Linux university course.

Can you rewrite this question in a way that does not contain the partial solution, and that totally explains the problem from scratch? Ensure that your statement stands alone. Don't reference the fact that this was adapted from a StackOverflow question, write it totally self-contained.

The user is working in a docker container running Alpine. For security reasons, I'm only okay with them running commands inside this single docker container. The problem statement should not require them to make any changes they can't do from inside the container. E.g. they can't reconfigure the container's memory limits, run a bootloader (except using a VM tool which can work via CLI), or use Bluetooth. If the problem statement assumes a different distro, please try to convert it to being about Alpine. If you do this, please make the problem as natural as possible.

I don't want the assignment to force users to use any interactive shell commands on the linux system they've SSH'd into. E.g. it shouldn't require them to use a particular text editor, any GUI application, or tools that fundamentally require interaction. The students will work by repeatedly using `docker exec` to run commands inside the container.

If you can't convert the problem to this context where they do all their work inside a docker container (perhaps producing internal containers with docker-in-docker as needed) and don't use interactive tools, say so and include a :cry: emoji in your response.

Also, ensure that the problem statement will allow the user to test their work very quickly. E.g. don't ask them to make programs that do things at specified intervals.

If your problem statement involves asking the student to write a script that measures or checks something, you should ask them to run it twice in different conditions, so that you confirm the script doesn't just have constant output.

Don't tell them the shell commands that they should use; just describe what they need to achieve.

Don't take shortcuts 'for demonstration purposes'. When applicable, clarify that the student is required to use real tools, real files rather than dummy files, and real servers, etc; make them install tools and acquire example files as needed.

Here are some examples of well-written problem statements. Match this format exactly in your answer. Each step should be a step the student takes in solving the problem; it should be a task the user is required to perform.

<problem>
Step 1. Write a program that, when it receives a message from another process (using your choice of IPC mechanism), connects to a local Redis server, sets a key, and then closes the connection. Verify that your script is working correctly by ensuring that the Redis operation is successful after you start this process and signal it.
Step 2. Create a separate program or command-line statement to output the number of currently open file descriptors by your main application. Run this monitoring script or command after your application has been signalled twice and six times. You should see that the number of currently open file descriptors does not change.
Step 3. Create a new program similar to your first, but which leaks file descriptors when signalled. Run this script in the background and then run your monitoring script or command again. You should see that the number of currently open file descriptors increases.
</problem>

<problem>
Step 1. Create a program that generates small files with random content in a specified working directory. The program should create a new file every time it receives a message from another process (using your choice of IPC mechanism). Confirm that your program is working correctly by running it, signalling it five times, and inspecting the produced files.
Step 2. Construct a lightweight, user-space isolation mechanism for your file generation program to ensure that it can only read from and write to the specified working directory. This isolation should not rely on root privileges or modify system-wide settings.
Step 3. Verify the isolation by attempting to read from and write to a file outside of the designated working directory using the isolated program. The attempt should fail. Test this twice with different files outside the working directory to ensure consistency.
</problem>

<problem>
Step 1. Install a mail retrieval utility. This utility will be used to retrieve emails from a remote server.
Step 2. Configure Fetchmail so that you can manually check for emails using the IMAP protocol. Use a configuration file to specify the server, user credentials. To test this, send yourself mail.
Step 3. Create a local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) configuration to deliver emails to the local user's mail directory. The mail should be stored in /var/mail/USERNAME or a similar directory that Fetchmail will recognize.
Step 4. Validate that the Fetchmail setup is working correctly by running a command that shows the number of emails in the local user’s mail directory. Run this command immediately after Fetchmail retrieves emails to ensure that the mail count has increased.
Step 5. Write a small monitoring script that reports the timestamp of the last email retrieved by Fetchmail. Run this script before and after you trigger an email retrieval to observe a change in the timestamp, ensuring that the Fetchmail setup is actively retrieving emails.
Step 6. Test the ability to read emails from the command line using Alpine's mail utility or another suitable mail user agent (MUA) that can read mails from the local mail directory. Use commands to list the emails and ensure that the output matches the expected email count reported by Fetchmail.
Step 7. Run the MUA to read the subject line of the most recently received email in the local mail directory, confirming the correct retrieval and delivery of email content.
</problem>

<problem>
Step 1. Install a network sniffing tool that can monitor network traffic on your network interface. Verify its installation by running the tool and displaying available network interfaces.
Step 2. Write a program that acts as a simple server responding to a specific network request on a designated port. The server should log the request for verification purposes. Test your server by sending a network request to the designated port and verify that it responds correctly by checking the logs.
Step 3. Write a second program that listens for network traffic related to the specific network request on the same port that the simple server is using. When such a request is detected, the program should record the event. Run your server from Step 2 and this detection program simultaneously, then send a test request to the server. Verify through the logs that the detection program captured the event.
Step 4. Modify the simple server from Step 2 to enter a low-power state after a set period of inactivity (for example, 1 second). The server, while in the low-power state, should not respond to any requests. Confirm that your server enters the low-power state by observing a lack of response when sending a request after the inactivity period has passed.
Step 5. Enhance the detection program from Step 3 to send a wake-up signal to the simple server when a relevant network request is detected while the server is in the low-power state. Ensure the server exits the low-power state and begins responding again by sending a test request after the server has entered the low-power state and verifying that it wakes up and handles the request correctly.
Step 6. Finally, run your enhanced server and detection program, and confirm that the server enters the low-power state as intended and then correctly wakes up and handles a request after receiving the wake-up signal from the detection program. Conduct this test twice with a short time interval between tests to ensure consistency in behavior.
</problem>

Things to note about those examples:

- We didn't tell them what language to program in.
- We didn't tell them to install Redis--they'll have to do that, but that is implicit.
- Every step involved implementing something on the system and then checking it worked. There are no steps that ask the user to do something else. E.g. we don't ask the user to explain something, or to document something.
- No notes were included.
- No URLs were included.
- We never told them to do things that involve waiting for timeouts, or that involve programs that do things at particular intervals; instead, we ask them to write programs that respond to signals.
- We told the user to write a program in cases where we imagine they might want to use the functionality repeatedly. But for one-off tasks, we asked them to just solve the problem in the command line, rather than to write a script. Please don't ask them to write scripts unnecessarily; it's usually better for them to solve problems incrementally by running a sequence of commands.
- We never told them a particular command to run--we just asked them to solve particular problems.
- The user is never asked to make any choices about what problem to solve; they are only allowed to make choices about how to implement their solutions. We were very specific.
- The user never has to do anything outside the Docker container--everything is just a command run inside the container (implicitly, it's being done using a `docker exec` command; we don't refer to this directly, it's just how their commands are actually executed; we just ask them to run commands). We don't even refer to the fact they're using a docker container: we just ask them to do stuff, bearing in mind that it will be done in the container. We never mention Dockerfiles unless we explicitly want them to use Docker-in-Docker. Everything is just described in terms of running commands on a Linux machine.

Is there a way to convert this problem into an exercise that can be done in this context? If so, rewrite the question in a similar way, in a `problem` XML tag. Otherwise, instead of responding with a `problem` XML element, include a :cry: emoji in your response.
