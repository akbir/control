# Low-Stakes AI Control

This repo contains code for the Low-Stakes AI Control paper (real name TBD). Currently, it is limited to only the micro-protocol code - the macro-protocol exists in a separate repo that I haven't moved over here yet.

## Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
```bash
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

If using conda, you can instead install the dependencies using the following command.
```bash
conda env create -f env.yaml
```

For development we use pre-commit hooks. To install pre-commit hooks, run the following command.
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Next we need to install APPS dataset. Run the following command to download the dataset.

```bash
mkdir data
curl https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hendrycks/APPS.tar.gz -o data/APPS.tar.gz
tar -xvf data/APPS.tar.gz -C data/
```

You will also need to test the provided APPS solutions to find the ones that actually pass all tests for each problem (this is not guaranteed for some reason). You can run the following command to generate the list of problems that have working solutions.
```bash
python -c "from src.tools.preprocess import get_working_solutions; get_working_solutions()"
```

NOTE: This is required in order to run the experiments in the paper, because our exploit evaluation code requires every problem to have a working solution.

### Test different protocols


#### Trusted Monitoring
```bash
python -m src.experiments.five_shot
```

#### Task Decomposition
```bash
python -m src.experiments.task_decomposition
```

#### Data Collection
The actual data used by the macro-protocol was generated using the `data_collection` pipeline, which has detailed instructions on how to run it in the `experiments/data_collection_instructions.md` file and an output file schema in the `data_collection_output_schema.json` file. This pipeline was run via the notebook `run_experiments.ipynb`, but you could also run it via the command line like so:
```bash
python -m src.experiments.data_collection
```

## Notebook version
The top-level notebook `run_experiments.ipynb` contains code used to instantiate and run the pipelines that represent the various micro-protocols in the paper. It also contains code for analyzing the data, such as evaluating monitor AuROC, doing individual problem analysis, and running the naive macro-protocol.
